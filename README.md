# Smart University Examination Timetable Generator

A C++17 console application that schedules university exams with no student clashes, using as few time slots as possible.

**Live demo — Slotwise:** https://exam-timetable-generator-eta.vercel.app is a web app on top of the same C++ engine, compiled to WebAssembly.

It models the problem as **graph colouring** and solves it with **Greedy**, **Backtracking** and **Branch and Bound**.

| Concept   | In the graph                                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Subject   | Vertex                                        |
| Conflict  | Edge (the two subjects share a student batch) |
| Time slot | Colour                                        |
| Goal      | Proper colouring with the fewest colours (chromatic number χ) |

## 2. Build and run

Requires only `g++` with C++17 support. There are no external dependencies.

```bash
make
```

```bash
./timetable
```

```bash
make test
```

Without `make`:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -Iinclude src/*.cpp -o timetable
```

Single-file version, which is identical code with the files concatenated:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O2 main_single.cpp -o timetable
```

After editing anything in `include/` or `src/`, run `make single` to regenerate `main_single.cpp` and build it.

Both builds compile with **zero warnings** using `-Wall -Wextra`, and also using `-Wpedantic -Wshadow`.
The self-tests run 30 checks, and all of them pass.

### Web version (Slotwise)

`web/` is **Slotwise**, a browser front end for the unchanged C++ engine. It has five pages:

* **Overview** — engine status and dataset statistics.
* **Timetable** — the day × session grid, with hover-to-inspect conflicts.
* **Conflict graph** — interactive and coloured by slot.
* **Algorithm lab** — greedy vs optimal side by side, plus every algorithm in one table.
* **Data** — enter your own data. **Quick entry** takes whole lists of time slots, batches and subjects at once; the Subjects, Batches and Time slots tabs edit one record at a time; **Import & samples** loads a data file or an optional demo dataset.

The **Engine console** gives the original menu.

Slotwise starts empty and never needs the built-in samples. In **Data → Quick entry**, type or paste one line per record:

```
Time slots     Day 1 - 09:00 AM                         (one label per line, or "generate" days x sessions)
Batches        CSE Year 1 | 60 | CS101, MA101, PH101     (name | students | subject codes)
Subjects       CS101 | Programming Fundamentals           (optional: code | name | students)
```

Subjects named in a batch are created automatically, and every pair of subjects in one batch becomes a clash. Time slots can be switched on and off in the Time slots tab, which controls which slots the engine may use.

How it connects:

* `make web` compiles `src/*.cpp` to WebAssembly with Emscripten, running in the `emscripten/emsdk` Docker image.
* The engine runs in a Web Worker (`web/worker.js`) and still talks over stdin/stdout. In the browser, `Console::readLine` waits for a line from the page using Emscripten's Asyncify.
* The GUI uses a small **machine protocol** on that same stdin/stdout (`include/MachineApi.h`). At the main-menu prompt, a line `@<id> <verb> [payload]` returns exactly one `@@BEGIN <id> / {json} / @@END <id>` block.
* Verbs: `state`, `run greedy|backtrack|bnb`, `compare`, `sample`, `subject.add`, `batch.add`, `slot.set`, `save`/`load`, `tests` and more.
* Every number the GUI shows comes from these responses. Nothing is computed in JavaScript.
* The protocol works in the terminal build too, for example `printf '@1 sample b\n@2 compare\n14\n' | ./timetable`.

The output in `web/` is plain static files:

```bash
npx vercel deploy --prod
```

## 3. Menu

```
 1. Manage subjects (add / remove)           9. COMPARE: Basic Greedy vs Optimal
 2. Manage student batches (add / remove)   10. Display statistics
 3. Manage time slots                       11. Load built-in sample dataset
 4. View all data                           12. Save / load data file
 5. View conflict graph                     13. Clear all data
 6. Generate timetable - Greedy             14. Exit
 7. Generate timetable - Backtracking (k)   15. Toggle ANSI colours
 8. Generate optimal timetable - B&B        16. Run self-tests
```

Quick demo: choose **11 → 2** to load Sample B, then **9** to compare.
Choose **11 → 3** to load Sample C, then try **6**, **7** with k = 8, **8** with a node limit of 20, and **9** to see an infeasible greedy result, a backtracking cut-off, a B&B cut-off and a slot saved by B&B.

## 4. Data file format

The file is plain text with one record per line.
Fields are separated by `|`, so names cannot contain `|`. Lines starting with `#` are comments.

```
SUBJECT|id|code|name|studentCount        (0 = derive from batches)
BATCH|id|name|studentCount|subjectId,subjectId,...
SLOT|id|label|available                  (1 or 0)
```

The loader validates the whole file before replacing the current data, so a bad file never leaves you with half-loaded data.
